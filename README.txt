JEI Recipe History for 1.16.5

Real simple, takes a chunk of the bottom panel of JEI to store recipes you've recently viewed. 

Can configure a few things in the toml.

I've never worked in 1.16.5 before, and this is my first time creating an addon for an existing mod. Had to hack some things to get it to work, so many apologies
if something is super wonky.
